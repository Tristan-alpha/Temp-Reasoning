    "original_solution": "To find the probability that Allison's roll is greater than both Brian's and Noah's rolls, we first analyze the outcomes for each person's cube.\n\nAllison's cube always rolls a 5 since all faces are 5.\n\nBrian's cube has faces numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The possible outcomes for Brian are: \n\n- 1\n- 2\n- 3\n- 4\n- 5\n- 6\n\nNoah's cube has three faces with a 2 and three faces with a 6. The possible outcomes for Noah are:\n\n- 2 (with probability 3/6 = 1/2)\n- 6 (with probability 3/6 = 1/2)\n\nNow, we need to determine the conditions under which Allison's roll (5) is greater than both Brian's and Noah's rolls.\n\n1. **Condition for Brian**: Allison's roll (5) is greater than Brian's roll if Brian rolls a 1, 2, 3, or 4. The outcomes where Allison's roll is greater than Brian's are:\n\n   - Brian rolls 1: (5 > 1)\n   - Brian rolls 2: (5 > 2)\n   - Brian rolls 3: (5 > 3)\n   - Brian rolls 4: (5 > 4)\n\n   Therefore, there are 4 favorable outcomes for Brian.\n\n2. **Condition for Noah**: Allison's roll (5) is greater than Noah's roll if Noah rolls a 2. The outcomes where Allison's roll is greater than Noah's are:\n\n   - Noah rolls 2: (5 > 2)\n\n   Therefore, there is 1 favorable outcome for Noah.\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of outcomes for Brian and Noah:\n\n- Brian has 6 possible outcomes.\n- Noah has 2 possible outcomes (2 or 6).\n\nNow, we can find the total number of outcomes for both Brian and Noah combined:\n\nTotal outcomes = (Number of outcomes for Brian) \u00d7 (Number of outcomes for Noah) = 6 \u00d7 2 = 12.\n\nNow, we find the number of favorable outcomes where Allison's roll is greater than both Brian's and Noah's:\n\n- For Brian, the favorable outcomes are 1, 2, 3, and 4 (4 outcomes).\n- For Noah, the only favorable outcome is 2 (1 outcome).\n\nThus, the total number of favorable outcomes where Allison's roll is greater than both Brian's and Noah's is:\n\nFavorable outcomes = (Favorable outcomes for Brian) \u00d7 (Favorable outcomes for Noah) = 4 \u00d7 1 = 4.\n\nFinally, we calculate the probability that Allison's roll is greater than both Brian's and Noah's:\n\nProbability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total outcomes) = 4 / 12 = 1 / 3.\n\nThus, the probability that Allison's roll is greater than each of Brian's and Noah's is:\n\n\\(\\frac{1}{3}\\)",
