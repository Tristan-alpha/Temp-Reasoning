      "Step 1: <think>\nOkay, so I need to find the positive integer n that makes the expression n/2 + 18/n as small as possible. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this. Maybe I can start by plugging in some small positive integers and see what happens? Let's try n=1 first. If n=1, then the expression becomes 1/2 + 18/1, which is 0.5 + 18 = 18.5. That's pretty big. What about n=2? Then it's 2/2 + 18/2 = 1 + 9 = 10. That's better. n=3 would be 3/2 + 18/3 = 1.5 + 6 = 7.5. Even smaller. n=4: 4/2 + 18/4 = 2 + 4.5 = 6.5. Still going down. n=5: 5/2 + 18/5 = 2.5 + 3.6 = 6.1. Hmm, getting closer. n=6: 6/2 + 18/6 = 3 + 3 = 6. That's lower. What about n=7? 7/2 + 18/7 \u2248 3.5 + 2.571 \u2248 6.071. Wait, that's actually a bit higher than 6. So n=6 gives 6, n=7 gives approximately 6.071. Let me check n=5 again. Wait, n=5 was 6.1, which is higher than 6. So maybe n=6 is the minimum? But let me check n=4 again. n=4 was 6.5, which is higher. What about n=3? 7.5. So it seems like n=6 gives the smallest value so far. But wait, maybe there's a non-integer n that gives a smaller value? The problem asks for positive integer n, so even if there's a non-integer that gives a smaller value, we need the closest integer. Let me recall that for expressions like a/n + bn, the minimum occurs at n=sqrt(a/b), but here the expression is n/2 + 18/n. Let me see. Let's set f(n) = n/2 + 18/n. To find the minimum, take derivative with respect to n, set to zero. But since n is a positive integer, maybe calculus can give an approximate value. Let's treat n as a continuous variable. Then f'(n) = 1/2 - 18/n\u00b2. Setting derivative to zero: 1/2 = 18/n\u00b2 => n\u00b2 = 36 => n=6. So the minimum occurs at n=6. Since 6 is an integer, that's our answer. But just to confirm, let's check n=5,6,7. As before, n=5: 6.1, n=6:6, n=7\u22486.071. So yes, n=6 is indeed the minimum. Therefore, the answer is </think>\n6.",
